Middle centuries:

In 508, the city became the capital of the Merovingian kingdom. In the VI century churches and monasteries were built everywhere. At that time, the population was 15-20 thousand inhabitants. A fortress towered on the Sieve, the residences of the king and the church authorities were located. The basis of the city's existence was trade, and the possibility of access to the sea (via the Seine) contributed to the appearance of merchants from the East — mainly Syrian and Jewish.
In the VII century, Paris lost its metropolitan function after the king of the Franks, Chlothar II, moved to Clichy, and later Charlemagne to Aachen. After the accession to the throne of the first king of France of the Capetian dynasty, Hugo Capet, at the end of the X century, again became the capital of France
